```{r setup, echo=F, results='hide'}
Sys.setenv(R_NOTEBOOK_HOME = getwd())
```


First, copy the tokenized files into a location where SourcererCC will look for its input (`input/dataset/blocks.file`):

```{bash}
cd $R_NOTEBOOK_HOME
cd tools/SourcererCC/clone_detector
cp ../../../datasets/js/tokenized_files.csv input/dataset/blocks.file
```
    
Then, run SourcererCC by invoking the controller:

```{bash}
cd $R_NOTEBOOK_HOME
python controller.py
```
    
SourcererCC runs distributed across multiple nodes and when finished, the result from the nodes must be joined together into a `sourcerer.csv` file in the dataset. Assuming 2 nodes were used, the following command should be executed:

```{bash}
cd $R_NOTEBOOK_HOME
cat NODE_*/output8.0/query_* > ../../../datasets/js/sourcerer.csv
```
