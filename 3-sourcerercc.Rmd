First, copy the tokenized files into a location where SourcererCC will look for its input (`input/dataset/blocks.file`):

    cd tools/SourcererCC/clone_detector
    cp ../../../datasets/js/tokenized_files.csv input/dataset/blocks.file
    
Then, run SourcererCC by invoking the controller:

    python controller.py
    
SourcererCC runs distributed across multiple nodes and when finished, the result from the nodes must be joined together into a `sourcerer.csv` file in the dataset. Assuming 2 nodes were used, the following command should be executed:

    cat NODE_*/output8.0/query_* > ../../../datasets/js/sourcerer.csv
    
When done, return back to root directory:

    cd ../../..
