```{r setup, echo=F, results='hide'}
Sys.setenv(R_NOTEBOOK_HOME = getwd())
```

> Do not execute this notebook on the Virtual Machine during artifact evalation, all necessary tools have already been setup for you in advance.

Download a snapshot of [GHTorrent MySQL dump](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html), and extract the projects table, such as:

```{bash}
cd $R_NOTEBOOK_HOME
mkdir ghtorrent
cd ghtorrent
curl https://ghtstorage.blob.core.windows.net/downloads/mysql-2017-01-19.tar.gz -o ghtorrent.tar.gz
tar --extract --file=ghtorrent.tar.gz mysql-2017-01-19/projects.csv
tar --extract --file=ghtorrent.tar.gz mysql-2017-01-19/project_commits.csv
mv mysql-2017-01-19/projects.csv projects.csv
mv mysql-2017-01-19/project_commits.csv project_commits.csv
rm -rf mysql-2017-01-19
cd ..
```    
    
Note that the exact paths will differ based on the exact mysql snapshot used, but at the end of this step you should have the files `ghtorrent/projects.csv` and `ghtorrent/project_commits.csv` ready.

> The file `project_commits.csv` will be required for metadata acquisition in step 7.
